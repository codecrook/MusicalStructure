# MusicalStructure


MusicalStructure is a simple application to imitate some basic actions of a simple music player. Note that this is NOT a music player application. It's just a design, or we can say replica.

## What's in the App

* The App basically shows a list of songs on a `Playlist` screen
* By clicking each entry on the Playlist screen it navigates to a `Player` Screen where it shows details like, Song title, Artist name and duration of the song in a layout similar to most of the popular music player app.
* The App doesn't play any song or respond to any controll button press on Player screen. Those are just dummy controlls
